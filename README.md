# Typing Speed Test
This is a simple web application that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. The application presents the user with a series of random words, and the user must type them as quickly and accurately as possible within a given time limit. After the time is up, the application provides feedback on the user's performance, including words per minute and accuracy.
